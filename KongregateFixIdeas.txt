Currently:

attack speed / movement speed 
(between 2 and 8)

damage (more is better, between 30 - 80 usually)

range 
1) either can't hit enemies, can hit some, or can hit most

hp 
2) (less than a certain amount and instantly die, eventually all towers instantly die)

hp regen 
3) (less than a certain amount and will die very fast if ever hit)

network (towers become duplicates)

a) Once you have a great allele it effectively applies to all your towers.
b) Once you have enough slow a certain quantity of enemies are effectively stopped.
c) Fire rate is too fast for user to pay attention to individual attacks


Fixes:

1) 	- Range must be modified by very little, or modified in very small increments.
	- Range is also a factor of tower type?
2)	- Bugs need to do much less damage than towers have, a good balancing metric is that towers should not be able to last very long if they attack themselves (player does a lot of damage, but has very little HP, and bugs don't really do that much damage but have much more HP)
3)	-

Movable towers
Deletable towers

Attack speed - between 0.1 and 0.6

Raw damage (kills per second):
floor(hp/damage)*attack speed

Damage buffer window:
path in range approx = (range - 16)/32 * 4 + 1
+(path in range)*32/enemy movement speed * kills per second


HP/hp regen:
Hp bars around tower, each bar constant hp, each side heals in constant time. Bars form more layers as needed.


Attack damage/speed:
Attack mechanism is visible and always running to show speed.
Components of it scale and change to show speed and damage.

Entire component scales to show damage (so if damage is a constant ratio to hp... then it appears normal, when they become out of balance it starts to look different. High hp but low damage has a tiny little weapon (in comparison to body), while low hp but high damage has a massive weapon (which may even overshadow body).

Tower body scales based on max hp (but not linearily!), and so does weapon size to weapon damage. Tower size is the max of the 2.
